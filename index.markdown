Strophe is a collection of libraries for speaking the
[XMPP](http://xmpp.org) protocol. While most XMPP libraries and
implementations are focused on chat-based applications, Strophe takes
a grander view. It has been used to implement real-time games,
notification systems, search engines, as well as traditional instant
messaging.

The implementations are production ready, well documented, easy to
use, and easy to extend.

# The Strophe Family

There are currently two members of the Strophe family of libraries.

## Strophe.js

[Strophe.js](http://strophe.im/strophejs) is a JavaScript
implementation targeting browser-based clients. It uses
[BOSH](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/technology-overview/bosh/), a
binding of XMPP to HTTP using long polling and WebSockets, a full-duplex
single socket connection to a server. Strophe.js makes creating
real-time web applications easy.

## libstrophe

[libstrophe](http://strophe.im/libstrophe) is a C library for XMPP
clients and components. It has very minimal dependencies and was
designed with both POSIX and Windows systems in mind.
